# FT Engine - Professional Electronic Referee System

Language: [English](README.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)

FT Engine is an Electron desktop scoring application for competitive events. It supports BLE/USB clickers, SINGLE/DUAL referee modes, OBS overlays, YouTube scoring timelines, historical reports, and exports.

## Current Architecture

Route B is being introduced incrementally. The current application is a working dual-runtime transition:

- Window, overlay, device, live-match, and primary historical reads use constrained IPC.
- Electron Main's `MatchSessionService` connects the Platform Worker, TypeScript scoring domain, and atomic live SQLite event writes while publishing continuous save/worker/media status to the scoring UI.
- The legacy FastAPI backend still owns project creation/loading, groups, media URL normalization, and exports. Settings and device remarks use SQLite IPC. Legacy hardware and WebSocket routes remain in the process but are no longer called by Electron live scoring.
- SQLite schema v5 supports migration backups, legacy import, live-managed projects, historical reads, and live events, but new matches still require a legacy project source.

See [current architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE_CURRENT_zh.md) and the [remaining Route B plan](docs/REFACTOR_PLAN_ROUTE_B_zh.md). Do not assume the localhost backend has already been removed.

## Features

- Free and Tournament modes.
- BLE/USB clickers with single and dual-device referees.
- Platform Worker BLE/USB shutdown when leaving scoring or closing the application.
- Live scoring, major penalties, waveform display, and contestant navigation.
- Transparent OBS-friendly overlay and target-window positioning.
- YouTube video scoring, playback anchors, and score overlays during replay.
- Historical reports plus CSV, SRT, and ZIP exports.
- Chinese, English, and Japanese UI.

## Development

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 22+.
- Python 3.10+; the project `.venv` is recommended.
- Bluetooth and the relevant USB drivers for physical-device development.

~~~bash
npm install
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
npm run dev
~~~

Electron currently starts the legacy backend, Platform Worker, and SQLite together. The development Renderer normally uses `http://localhost:5173`; the legacy backend defaults to `127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Verification

~~~bash
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
python -m unittest discover -s tests
~~~

Node tests cover the scoring domain, IPC/Worker protocol, security boundary, SQLite, legacy import, reports, and replay. Python tests cover device protocols and services, platform adapters, legacy scoring parity, and media anchors.

## Packaging

~~~bash
npm run build:backend
npm run build:unpack
npm run build:win
npm run build:mac
~~~

Transition builds still package two Python executables: `backend-engine` for the legacy FastAPI runtime and `local-platform-worker` for the JSONL stdio worker.

## Local Data

Development data is written under the repository; packaged builds use Electron's user-data directory.

| Data | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `config.yaml` | Legacy backend runtime configuration |
| `app_settings.json` | Dormant settings for legacy backend routes |
| `match_data/` | Authoritative legacy projects and CSV files |
| `ft-engine.db` | Authoritative live events and app settings; shadow/imported project data |
| `backups/` | Pre-migration SQLite backups |
| `logs/` | Startup and runtime logs |

Typical packaged locations are `%APPDATA%/FT Engine/` on Windows and `~/Library/Application Support/FT Engine/` on macOS.
